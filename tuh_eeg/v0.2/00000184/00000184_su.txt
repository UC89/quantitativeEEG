classification	abnormall
summary_diagnosis	Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness and drowsiness, and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm; Bitemporal slowing, left more than right side seen during wakefulness and drowsiness;  No epileptiform abnormalities have been identified in this record.
impression	This is an abnormal EEG due to: 1. Diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness and drowsiness, and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm. 2. Bitemporal slowing, left more than right side seen during wakefulness and drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities have been identified in this record. 
clinical_correlation	The above findings could be due to toxic, metabolic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to effect of sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease. Bilateral temporal slowing that could be due to bilateral structural abnormalities or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures are identified in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
clinical_history	This is a 68-year-old, right-handed male, who presents with change in mental status and left-sided weakness.  Past medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
medications	Norvasc, isosorbide, aspirin, lisinopril, Norvasc, Lipitor, nicotine patch, metoprolol, and digoxin.
